The setup is complete and now comes the assignments of users and their roles. Here we establish a few users with their own logins and create a heirarchy. An "admin" user is created to show the features they have to navigate through osTicket. Another user that is created is not an admin but can use their features in their respective roles to create tickets. Once the ticket is sent out, the admin can send it to whichever team or role is able to fullfil the ticket and at what priority the ticket is assigned to be. Obviously this is for demonstration to show how the tickets are processed so no work is actually done to complete the ticket.

After showing the process of the ticketing system, it's time to show the Security Levels and Teams. As mentioned in the previous objective, an Admin has the Security level to send a ticket to whichever department or team the ticket needs to complete said ticket. Some departments are available to all but others are for certain teams and users.
